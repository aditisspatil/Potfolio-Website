				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p class="main-text"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum 
		has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
		took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
		five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
		unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
		Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
		including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
				</p>
				<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
				<p class="main-text">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a 
		page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
		normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it 
		look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use 
		Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
		sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by 
		accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
