# My Portfolio Website

I created this website to showcase the projects I'd make in future, and provide UI to those projects.

I have used code and utilities provided by different vendors over internet, and all such files are placed in the "Vendors" folder.

The animations used on the page are using jquery.waypoints and animate.css, both downloaded directly from internet

The icons used are from ioncons v2

I have also used www.kyleledbetter.com website for reference and solving UI issues with media queries. I came across this site on a page that listed top 10 portfolio websites for sorftware developers.
