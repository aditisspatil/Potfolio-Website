# My Portfolio Website

I created this website as my portfolio website, where I can showcase all that I am working on.

I have used code and utilities provided by different vendors over internet, and all such files are placed in the "Vendors" folder.

##CSS:
1. Animate.css https://animate.style/#javascript

##JQuery:
1. jquery.waypoints  http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/
2.



The icons used are from ioncons v2

I have also used www.kyleledbetter.com website for reference and solving UI issues with media queries. I came across this site on a page that listed top 10 portfolio websites for sorftware developers.
